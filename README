Server1 and server2 exploits:
    To compile the exploits, run make.

    Both exploits take the same arguments, so they will only be listed here.
        -b <buffer size>
            This is the size of the argument to be passed to the server
        -e <environment variable size>
            This is the size of the environment variable containing the shellcode.
                It will be filled with NOPs with the shellcode at the end.
        -a <alignment>
            This is an alignment agjustment for the NOPs in the environment variable.
        -o <offset>
            This is an offset for the address we are jumping to.

    exploit1:
        To successfully exploit server1, call 
            ./exploit1 -b 388 -a 2

    exploit2:
        To successfully exploit server2, call
            ./exploit2 -b 424 -a 2
