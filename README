Here, I give you a simple example: attack.c and server.c
You should use "cc" to compile them. Do not use gcc here.
cc -o attack attack.c  
cc -o server server.c

If you are in apache:  run ./attack or ./attack -20    just try 
Try different offset if it is not working for you such as -80.
It will work.
After you enter SHELL successfully, you can type "exit" to exit it.

Do not use the attack program to write your exploit code. 
This program is not good - not flexible. Think about why?
You should use one of the programs listed
in the document linked in the course web page. Find it yourself.

Two programs server1 and server2 were compiled by cc
You need to exploit server1 and server2

I did not show you the complete source code of server1.c.
But I have given you the complete source code of
server2.c.

TA will login to apache to test your programs so make sure that your
programs work in Apache.
